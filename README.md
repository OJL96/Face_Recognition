# _Computer Vision - Face Recognition_
### Project Description 
Three algorithms evaulated on their performance to identify the correct face (or class) given a face image (face recognition) where the class corresponds to a celebrity or historical figure. Cross-correlation, FaceNet, and Deep VGG were used in this project where cross-correlation acting as a baseline for the other more robust methods. The dataset only consists of one training example per class thus one-shot learning methods are favoured. The testing set holds multiple variations of each class to make recognition more difficult (occulsion, lighting, poses, etc.). The scope of this project is see how well deep learning methods perform on the testing set given a single training example per class. Please read the report for a more detailed analysis.
